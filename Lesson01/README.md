[User Experience - Autumn 2025](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-kea/WD_UX_E25/blob/main/README.md)

# Lesson 1 - 28 August

## Software installation
**Microsoft Visual Studio Code**

You need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). I will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but feel free to choose another if you have specific preferences.

Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions:
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)
- [htmltagwrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradgashler.htmltagwrap)
- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)

Many developers use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode), but I would prefer you to write and “prettify” your code yourselves so that you have full control over it, especially now that you are learning.

Many developers use [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot), but I strongly recommend that you stay away from it. Our experience says that in order to learn properly  young students need to code by themselves, even if it takes longer to have the code working.

**Git and GitHub**

Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the most popular SCM (Source Code Management) tool. Check out the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

If you still do not have it, create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/), the main code repository platform.

If you just want to try some small code projects to illustrate specific CSS or JavaScript features, you can try a lightweight front-end platform like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

## Class takeaways
### Basic Web Application Architecture
- Check out the **Introduction** slides

### CSS3
- Always use [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) (CSS variables), at least for colours and font lists
- Use [nested CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting), since it now has wide browser support
