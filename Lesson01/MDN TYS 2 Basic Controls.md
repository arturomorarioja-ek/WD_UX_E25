This task starts you off nice and gently by asking you to create two <input> elements, for a user's ID and password, along with a submit button.

Create appropriate inputs for user ID and password.
You should also associate them with their text labels semantically.
Create a submit button inside the remaining list item, with button text of "Log in".
Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

```html
<form>
  <ul>
    <li>
      User ID

    </li>
    <li>
      Password

    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
  </ul>
</form>
```

The next task requires you to create working sets of checkboxes and radio buttons, from the provided text labels.

Turn the first `<fieldset>`'s contents into a set of radio buttons â€” you should only be able to select one pony character at once.
Make it so that the first radio button is selected upon page load.
Turn the second `<fieldset>`'s content into a set of checkboxes.
Add a couple more hotdog choices of your own.
Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

<img width="793" height="378" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c2793fa-94fa-4ead-9013-f096afda6e4a" />

<form>
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Who is your favorite pony?</legend>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <label for="pinkie">Pinkie Pie</label>

            </li>
            <li>
