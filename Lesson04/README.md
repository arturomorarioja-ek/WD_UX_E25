## Homework

### CSS
Check out the slide deck **CSS3**, specifically the slide on classless CSS frameworks. The one I normally use is [water.css](https://watercss.kognise.dev/).

### JavaScript
Check out:
- The slide deck **JavaScript - The DOM**, with especial attention to the section Element Creation (which includes the use of document fragment)
- [The `switch` statement](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp) (known in some programming languages as `case`)
- Code samples:
  - [Append strategies](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_append_strategies)
  - [Append strategies 2](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_append_strategies_v2)
  - [Document fragment](https://codepen.io/arturomorarioja/pen/QwLaVMj)

### Information Architecture
- Check out the slides on **IA Navigation and Wayfinding**, with especial attention to:
  - Navigation structures
  - Wayfinding methods (breadcrumbs, URL structures, CTAs, landmarks and mega menus)

### Project Gutenberg - API consumption
Create an application that consumes the `books` endpoint of [Gutendex](https://gutendex.com/) (the Project Gutenberg API) and displays a series of book cards including book title, authors (notice that there can be more than one), cover image, description (there can be more than one, but just use the first one; notice that there can be no description, so account for it), and a link to the HTML version of the book in the Project Gutenberg page.
