# Lesson 10 - 6 November

[## Exercise solution]: #
[- Tristan Wede Lind(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/css_tristan_solution/)]: #

[General feedback. Things to improve:]: #
[- Avoid `<div>`. Use `<section>` whenever you can group elements in a meaningful (i.e., semantic) way (e.g., the `<footer>` elements)]: #
[- Review when to use `<section>` and when to use `<article>` (slide deck **HTML5**)]: #
[- Set your header tags (e.g., `<h4>`, `<h5>`) in a `<header>` tag]: #
[- Use `<aside>` for non-crucial information, for example, when it will be hidden in the mobile view (e.g., the books list in the top section)]: #
[- Organise your CSS code in separate files. Even if this is an SPA, it will help readability and maintainability]: #
