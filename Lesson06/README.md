General feedback. Things to improve
- Code should be divided into folders. As projects tend to grow, file organisation can soon become unmanageable
- Avoid absolute paths, as it limits the deployability of your project. Do never start a URL path with `/`
- CSS custom properties (variables) must be used for all colours and fonts, and they must be used consistently: just one hardcoded colour can cause grave problems regarding code maintainability
- CSS custom properties must also be used for fixed pixel dimensions
- Remember to load your JavaScript files either with `defer` or as modules
  - Because of loading JavaScript in deferred mode, targeting the `DOMContentLoaded` event is unnecessary

## In-class exercises

### CSS Grid
Complete the code in https://github.com/arturomorarioja/kea_grid_practice_initial using grid and flexbox so that Michel Foucaultâ€™s bio page looks like this:

<img width="1024" height="599" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a00e4ffe-bf34-461e-8062-4147948a35a0" />
