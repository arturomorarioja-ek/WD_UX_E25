Next week I will give you the solutions to the TMDB API consumption assignment. If you finish it by then, you will be able to compare your solution to mine.

**Information Architecture**

Create a sitemap for a popular website of your choice (not one with too many information levels, though). Use the sitemap format that you think more appropriate:
- Work in groups of 5 or 6
- Send me a pdf file with your sitemap on Teams, so that next week we can discuss your work
