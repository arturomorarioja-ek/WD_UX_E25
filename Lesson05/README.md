[## Homework exercise solution]: #
[Project Gutenberg(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_project_gutenberg)]: #

[- Complementary]: #
[- Analogous]: #
[- Triadic]: #
[- Tetradic]: #

[Show your findings to the class.]: #

[## Homework]: #
[Check out the following slide decks on Itslearning:]: #
[- **Visual Design: Colours and Typography**]: #
[- **Responsive Web Design**, with especial attention to:]: #
[- Responsive Web Design Recommendations]: #
[- CSS3 Media Queries]: #
[- Mobile First Design]: #
[- Flexbox]: #

[Bookmark CSS-Tricks' CSS Flexbox Layout Guide(https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). It is a great aid for working with Flexbox.]: #
 
[Check out the following code samples:]: #
[- Responsive font and image(https://codepen.io/arturomorarioja/pen/MWzpJjG)]: #
[- Flexbox(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/css_flexbox)]: #

[### First Mandatory Assignment]: #
