[## First Mandatory Assignment exercise solution]: #
[- API consumption(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_tmdb)]: #

[General feedback. Things to improve:]: #
[- Do not repeat code. It is bad for performance (more lines to load) and for maintainability (a change affects several files instead of just one). This assignment must be done with only one HTML file and only one JavaScript function]: #
[- Do never send your API keys to anyone, of course never to a GitHub repo. Someone can reuse them to attack the corresponding server on your behalf]: #
[- Remember to load your JavaScript files in the <head> as modules or with defer]: #
[- Do not forget to use custom properties (CSS variables) for ALL your colours, font families, and fixed pixel widths (e.g., image or card dimensions)]: #

[## Homework]: #
[- Deliver all your First Mandatory Assignment pending exercises. The deadline is on Wednesday!]: #
